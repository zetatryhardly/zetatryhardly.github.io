    <main>
        <h1>Roguelikes</h1>
        <p>For some reason there are a lot of free roguelikes, either community developed or passion projects. The list might get expanded and pretty pictures might be added in the future. Until then here are some of my recommendations:</p>
        <h2>Tomes of Maj‚ÄôEyal</h2>
        <p>ToME is a passion project of one dev, and this is the one I‚Äôd even recommend if you never played a roguelike before. The game is available on Steam, but you can download a free verison from the <a href="https://te4.org/">official site</a>. As roguelikes go it‚Äôs pretty easy to get into (at least compared to some of the other ones), it has nice albeit simple graphics and multiple difficulty settings. UI is nice and clear, you don‚Äôt have to memorize keybinds if you don‚Äôt want to. In the default mode you have multiple lives but there is an option for true roguelike mode or exploration mode for infinite lives.</p>

        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Friendly UI, with pretty buttons to click</li>
            <li>Lots of skills, classes, subclasses and viable builds</li>
            <li>Instead of consumables there is a pretty interesting system, ideal for someone who would hoard potions otherwise</li>
            <li>There is a story with multiple endings (don‚Äôt expect some grand RPG but still, this is more than most roguelikes offer)</li>
            <li>Lore is scattered through the world, if you‚Äôre interested in that it‚Äôs fun to read, if not you can just easily ignore it</li>
            <li>Game is easily moddable and plenty of mods are available both for quality of life stuff and new classes, skills, dungeons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While the levels are randomly generated, the world map isn‚Äôt, and doing the same dungeons in the same order can be repetitive</li>
            <li>The escort quests (yes I know they‚Äôre optional, no I don‚Äôt care)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is some metaprogression in the game, some classes need to be unlocked. I wouldn‚Äôt consider this a con, especially since the unlockable classes are not stronger then the starting ones, but if you absolutely hate any kind of metaprogression this game might not be for you</li>
            <li>DLC's exist, but they‚Äôre not necessary to enjoy the game. The game is free and the DLC‚Äôs are cheap, so if you like the game consider supporting the devs</li>
            <li>Game is pretty long for a roguelike, and losing a character you played for a while is pain</li>
            <li>Not a sandbox, you can win the game</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</h2>

        <p>You like Project Zomboid but you suck at actually fighting in real time? Do you think PZ‚Äôs cooking system lacks detail because you can‚Äôt even make <a href="https://cdda-guide.nornagon.net/item/pie_maple?v=0.H-RELEASE">maple pie</a>? Ever wish it had a more sophisticated crafting so you could craft a full set of medieval armor, explosives or even cars from scratch? This game has those and more. You‚Äôll also probably die of dysentery before you achieve any of it.</p>
        <p>The stable version of the game can be downloaded from the <a href="https://cataclysmdda.org/">official site</a> . Since the game is actively developed, if you want to keep up with the current version I‚Äôd recommend using a launcher like <a href="https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult">this one</a>.</p>

        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So. Much. Detail. üòÄ</li>
            <li>Did I mention the crafting system was really good? You can make almost anything from scratch provided you have the materials, tools, skills and the time.</li>
            <li>You can customize the difficulty at world generation, and your survivor can be as OP or as weak as you want to. For starting out I‚Äôd recommend picking a martial artist with high stats for some ass-kicking.</li>
            <li>Mods exist and are actively developed, both for QoL stuff and complete overhauls, some mods are built into the game and you can just enable them at world generation if you want to.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So. Much. Detail. üòµ‚Äçüí´</li>
            <li>UI isn‚Äôt very modern, while there is mouse support you‚Äôre expected to remember some keys to interact with stuff</li>
            <li>The devs really like ‚Äúrealism‚Äù, with the default settings building and crafting can take a lot of time.</li>
            <li>Avoid the subreddit, for some reason people there are super hostile against the devs. While I‚Äôm pretty sure some of the criticism is legitimate, the posts are mostly about drama.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This is probably a pro for most people: to my understanding the game has fairly accurate representations of guns and ammo. I don‚Äôt know anything about guns, it mostly just confuses me</li>
            <li>Besides the zombies the game has some dimensional weirdness and aliens in the lore</li>
            <li>Very much a sandbox game, there is a story you can follow but you can never ‚Äúwin‚Äù</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h2>

        <p>DCSS is a classic roguelike, it‚Äôs been around for a long time and has a very active community. You can download versions for Windows, Linux, OS X or Android from the <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/">official site</a> or just play it in a browser. The game is one big dungeon, most levels are completely randomly generated while some special ones have a predetermined layout. The UI is not very beginner friendly, you‚Äôll need to use hotkeys for most things, there is a minimal amount of mouse control.
            
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul></ul>
            <li>It‚Äôll run on your laptop, phone or preferred toaster</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs relatively easy to start, hard to master</li>
            <li>In the browser version you can spectate others run and compete on daily leaderboards</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not very modern UI</li>
            <li>I wouldn‚Äôt consider it beginner friendly but it‚Äôs also far from some of the truly old school ASCII-nightmares</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a clear goal to win: get the orbs and get out of the dungeon</li>
        </ul>
