        <h1>Roguelikes</h1>
        <p>For some reason there are a lot of free roguelikes, either community developed or passion projects. Here are my recommendations:</p>
        <h2>Tomes of Maj’Eyal</h2>
        <p>This is the one I’d even recommend if you never played a roguelike before. ToME is a passion project of one dev, a fun roguelike available free on the dev’s website. As roguelikes go it’s pretty easy to get into (at least compared to some of the other ones), it has nice albeit simple graphics and multiple difficulty settings. UI is nice and clear, you don’t have to memorize keybinds if you don’t want to. In the default mode you have multiple lives but there is an option for true roguelike mode or exploration mode for infinite lives.</p>

        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Friendly UI</li>
            <li>Lots of skills, classes, subclasses and viable builds</li>
            <li>Instead of consumables there is a pretty interesting system, ideal for someone who would hoard potions otherwise</li>
            <li>There is a story with multiple endings (don’t expect some grand RPG but still, this is more than most roguelikes offer)</li>
            <li>Lore is scattered through the world, if you’re interested in that it’s fun to read, if not you can just easily ignore it</li>
            <li>Game is easily moddable and plenty of mods are available both for quality of life stuff and new classes, skills, dungeons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While the levels are randomly generated, the world map isn’t, and doing the same dungeons in the same order can be repetitive</li>
            <li>The escort quests (yes I know they’re optional, no I don’t care)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is some metaprogression in the game, some classes need to be unlocked. I wouldn’t consider this a con, especially since the unlockable classes are not stronger then the starting ones, but if you absolutely hate any kind of metaprogression this game might not be for you</li>
            <li>Game is pretty long for a roguelike</li>
            <li>Not a sandbox, you can win the game</li>
        </ul>
